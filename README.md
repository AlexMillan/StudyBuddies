# StudyBuddies
Study Buddies! Sign in with Facebook, add the classes you're taking this quarter, and connect with others who have the same classes as you. Select the classes that you are currently taking this quarter from the drop-down. The classes are imported from the school database so you should have no problem finding them. To connect with others, pull up the list of everyone in the class and send a chat invite. Connect with group chats or create your own. The chat system that will be used is firebase. Want to find someone to study with? Pull up the map to display the geographic location of anyone working on that class, but only if they choose to have their location on. This is will be accomplished using the phoneâ€™s GPS tracking. Also, keep in mind of the point/rating system others may give you. These points display how active &amp; reliable you are with others using the app.
